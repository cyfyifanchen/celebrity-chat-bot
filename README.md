I've tested, the project works fine with Bun 1.0. I'd recommend that you use it instead of using Node, it's a lot faster.

## Todos

- [] Setting Page
- [] Stripe API payment(needs to verify ID, don't have it at the moment, postponing...üôÅ)
- [] Text to voice: adding that would be fun.
- [] The logo isn't right, I couldn't get the `.ttf` working with Google Font at the moment, I will find out why.
- [x] Adding analytics
